Machine Learning-based ROI Prediction for Commercial Real Estate

This project focuses on predicting Return on Investment (ROI) in commercial real estate using machine learning techniques.
The goal is to provide data-driven insights that help investors and analysts make informed decisions in an uncertain market.

Features

Data preprocessing for handling raw property and financial datasets

Implementation of regression and ensemble learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, etc.)

ROI prediction pipeline with evaluation metrics

Practical application for real estate investment analysis
