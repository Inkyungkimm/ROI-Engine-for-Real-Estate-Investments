🏙️ Machine Learning-based ROI Prediction for Commercial Real Estate

Predicting Return on Investment (ROI) in commercial real estate is complex due to market volatility, property diversity, and regional dynamics.
This project applies machine learning to deliver reliable ROI forecasts, helping investors and analysts make smarter, data-driven decisions.

✨ Features

🧹 Data Preprocessing – Clean and structure raw property & financial data

🤖 Machine Learning Models – Regression and ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, etc.)

📈 ROI Prediction – Accurate ROI forecasting for commercial properties

🏢 Real-world Application – Supports real estate investment analysis and strategy
